Not only saved but loved back to much of it's caste iron magnificence.  And then these wonderful people turn out on a Sunday to guide and answer questions, nearly 50 of them.

In 1979 my father swapped Abbey mills for Broadholme treatment works in Rushden, Northamptonshire. Every now and then my old man would go back to London to see family and friends, on one of these trips he went back to Abbey mills to catch up with his old colleagues and I tagged along. I was five or six years old at the time and I can remember how fascinated and awestruck I was. One of my dad's old workmates had finished a maintenance job on one of the biggest pumps and I was given the privilege of starting it up. I can still remember being scared at the colossal noise that it made. My visit to Abbey mills is one of my fondest memories, they dont build em like they used to is a perfect description of this beautiful building. If ever you get the opportunity to take a tour of this amazing building you should grab it with both hands.",6,,2019-02-28,2020-01-15,2020-01-15,en,Abbey Mills Pumping Station,7139725,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d7139725-r739385111-Abbey_Mills_Pumping_Station-London_England.html

It's a privilege to be able to see how everything works and it's hard to book a visit so look out for opportunities during Open Hoise weekend and apply early.  Restoration to the paintwork inside has continued apace and when finished it will be stunning.  

My visit this time included a sewer walk!  If you are in any doubt about doing it don't worry.  You get full protective clothing: disposable overalls, 2 layers of gloves, socks to put on over your own, thigh length wader boots, a hard hat and you are fully harnessed.  12 of us went down the sewer and 4 staff with bright torches so it wasn't scarily dark.  A man about 6' 2"" stood up straight, there were only a couple of places where he needed to bend his head to go past.  It was one of my concerns that it would be a confined space which would trigger claustrophobia but truly, it's so big there's less space on a crowded rush hour underground train!  

Did it smell?  A bit, but it wasn't gag inducing, if you're worried put some Vicks or something like that under your nose.  Was it slippery?  Not really, the boots you have on have metal spikes in the soles and dig into anything soft so grip well.  Although it had rained a couple of hours before we went in the sewer there was only about 6"" of water so nothing to worry about.  You get excellent briefing from the staff on what to expect.  You climb down a wall ladder and are fully harnessed and cannot fall, everyone managed it. You can take a camera but NOT a mobile phone to take pictures.  

We had an excellent talk about how the sewer system started and a talk and video about the new system being installed.  And to finish off we had the most wonderful lunch!  I highly recommend this experience.  Good luck with trying to book.

He describes it as having elements of the Kremlin and Moorish architecture.  It is indeed a splendid pile to see. 

After visiting Three Mills nearby I mounted the Greenway via the Abbey Lane Open Space and wandered east along it several hundred metres until I came to a spot with a clear panorama of the buildings.  You can also take Abbey Road or West Ham DLR or the Jubilee / District / Hammersmith & City lines to West Ham.  

It would be an interesting place to tour; apparently, that opportunity is rare.  Take a walk along the Greenway to the QE Olympic Park and enjoy this as one of the sights along the way.  Also, check out Three Mills, which is a beautiful piece of architecture, too.",4,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/79/a3/9a/abbey-mills-pumping-station.jpg,2017-05-31,2017-06-04,2017-06-04,en,Abbey Mills Pumping Station,7139725,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d7139725-r490332568-Abbey_Mills_Pumping_Station-London_England.html

Thames Water did me proud!

I wasn't there for the buffet lunch, but it was excellent, but far too much for us to eat. My purpose was the lectures - absolutely excellent - about the history of sewage management and the develop of London sewers under the control of Bazalgette.  We then enjoyed an excellent, well-explained and very relaxed tour of the Pumping Station itself, followed by the primary purpose of my visit, the walk-through tour of the sewers. 

A short mini-bus hop to a nearby works site, then dressed up into our ""sewer rat"" uniform - socks, groin-high boots, two layers of gloves, a proper onesie, helmet, safety harness and box with gas mask!  Then we were clipped onto the safety system before descending the ladder into the huge sewer. Excellent commentary and explanations as we were guided through the c.1905 sewer up as far as a big junction and a view of the much older Bazalgette sewer - all of them so well built they never need rebuilding or - even - repointing!!  Back to base along the storm drain, adjacent to the sewer to cope with the - up to - 40 times increase in flow of a rainstorm. 

Thank you Thames Water ... and don't put fat down your sink, toilet or drain!!",6,,2017-05-31,2017-05-23,2017-05-23,en,Abbey Mills Pumping Station,7139725,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d7139725-r487109610-Abbey_Mills_Pumping_Station-London_England.html

It is a privilege to visit these buildings and although the tour was unstructured, the staff were very knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions.  The exhibition inside is very interesting but we didn't have enough time to look at it all properly and the map was so small and high up I couldn't really see it which was a shame.

I am pleased I went, however it is far less colourful inside than Crossness which is a true sight to behold.  There again Abbey Mills is still a working pumping station (fully automated) and Crossness has been lovingly restored by a dedicated team of volunteers.   It warrants a ""Good"" rating - so 3 1/2 stars really.

The outside of the building is worth a good look - take some binoculars if you want to see the higher up detail eg the Minton tiles and the weather vane which has a story all of its own. Get there by going to Abbey Road DLR, turn right, follow the road round and turn left into to Abbey Lane; Greenway was closed off for redevelopment when I went. 

Apparently there will be a tour of the pumping station in May 2016 which also takes in the sewers, you need to contact Thames Water to find out more.",5,,2015-09-30,2015-09-24,2015-09-24,en,Abbey Mills Pumping Station,7139725,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d7139725-r313269079-Abbey_Mills_Pumping_Station-London_England.html

The building is the northern twin to Crossness, but it doesn't have steam engines, although the building and engineering inside is impressive.

I got in once during one of Thames Water's Sewer Weeks, where I was also suited and booted and taken into the sewers under Hackney Wick. Who needs theme parks, when you can explore London's sewers?

For normal visits, it is often open during Open House weekends.",6,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/b5/d3/41/abbey-mills-pumping-station.jpg,2014-09-30,2014-10-10,2014-10-10,en,Abbey Mills Pumping Station,7139725,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d7139725-r233610606-Abbey_Mills_Pumping_Station-London_England.html

Abbey Mills is not generally open, although Thames Water does do occasional tours.

For those who like their engineering and architecture, as I do, it is a gem.

But if you walk past it on the Greenway, you can at least appreciate one of London's best pieces of Victorian architecture.
