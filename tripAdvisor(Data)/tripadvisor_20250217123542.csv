It had some trees, bushes and overgrown reeds in the water, but no wildlife at all. Not worth a visit at all

The park location has great potential as its a peninsula. Seems like the council isn't interested in improving the area at all. There isn't much to do here except for looking at wild growth and bushes. My suggestion, don't waste your time.",0,,2021-08-31,2021-09-05,2021-09-05,en,Limmo Peninsula Ecological Park,15094299,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d15094299-r808308911-Limmo_Peninsula_Ecological_Park-London_England.html

Perhaps we were expecting more bird and other animals.  The park is essentially a linear walk surrounded with trees and bushes. We saw no birds except a few gulls.  The peninsula is surrounded by water so would be pleasant relief on a hot day, but would not visit for potential bird watching.",2,,2018-09-30,2018-09-07,2018-09-06,en,Limmo Peninsula Ecological Park,15094299,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d15094299-r614508475-Limmo_Peninsula_Ecological_Park-London_England.html
