Sadly, on a cold Friday in late January the lighthouse and tge ships were closed off, so we will go back to see them on a sunny weekend day in the future.
One of the original buildings is re-purposed into an art gallery, which was the best part of our visit this time. The art that we saw was the finalists of John Ruskin Prize Exhibition, and the art was spectacular.
We had the chance to visit one of the in-house artists who was working in one of the container studios. He had time to show us his set-up and explained his art discipline. Around the container village are several art sculptures made by welding old bicycles, scrap copper cylinders etc. to create mobile sculptures. Sadly, none of them were moving and they didn't look as though they would move on a busy tourist day in the summer time either.
The Wharf has a lovely café called the Orchard Café. Great food, lovely views of the area through the large glass windows and fantastic staff.
We will go back and, on a sunny weekend, it may well get a 4 or 5 review.",0,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/ba/f1/e9/caption.jpg,2025-01-31,2025-02-01,2025-02-01,en,Trinity Bouy Warf,32884616,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d32884616-r991893779-Trinity_Bouy_Warf-London_England.html
