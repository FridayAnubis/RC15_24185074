It's not. It's in South London, Croydon specifically.

Fortunately I used google to locate the park which is on the track bed of the former British Rail branch line from Elmers End to Addiscombe. Hence the name of the park. The route was converted to the Croydon Tramlink and the route diverted towards Croydon.

It's a nice, well maintained area and there is a small pond and flowerbed on parts of the park.

When I visited there were people using the park to enjoy the area including walking dogs and cycling.

The park closes at sunset so don't get locked in.",0,,2022-11-30,2022-11-15,2022-11-15,en,Addiscombe Railway Park,21357347,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g504167-d21357347-r868553419-Addiscombe_Railway_Park-Croydon_Greater_London_England.html

I'm going to downgrade my previous review of the railway park to a single star. I stopped clearing rubbish from the railway park over winter 2021-22 but didn't restart when the weather got better in the spring because too many people obviously don't care about the environment and the litter problem has become so bad it's genuinely depressing. Part of the problem is that Croydon council didn't see the need to add more litter bins, but then they are financially restrained. The idea that care of Croydon's green spaces should be devolved to local groups isn't really an act of democracy but is rather another way to save money; a full partnership between the council and the local 'friends of' groups would be a better way of ensuring accountabilty, and may have prevented the parks being left unlocked at night. It's the night time when much of the littering - empty bottles and cans of alcohol - occurs, though drinking and casual recreational drug use is not uncommon during daylight hours. Dog faeces are another perennial problem, with no official patrols of the railway park to record breaches of the law or issue fines.
What was something of a haven during lockdown has become a nightmare, despite the best efforts of the volunteers, and until the government understands mental health issues and the relationship between declining mental wellbeing and the cost of living crisis, including providing much more money to local councils for upkeep of green spaces along with funds to ensure the provision of good local services, it's not going to improve any time soon.",0,,2022-07-31,2022-08-14,2022-08-14,en,Addiscombe Railway Park,21357347,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g504167-d21357347-r854038103-Addiscombe_Railway_Park-Croydon_Greater_London_England.html

The Addiscombe railway branch line was opened in 1864 following the acquisition of the Mid Kent Railway by South Eastern. It was closed in May 1997 to allow construction of Croydon Tramlink which uses part of the former route of the Woodside & South Croydon line, itself closed down in May 1983.
The station, demolished before full planning permission was granted, was turned into a housing development and the park site given over to Croydon Council by Bellway Homes in 2003. 
Addiscombe Railway Park was opened to the public on 26 May 2007 but suffered from flooding after heavy rain - the pathway crosses Norbury Brook somewhere around Dalmally Passage and the subsoil is impervious London Clay - since partially remedied by asphalting the surface to provide a cycle and footpath along much of its length.
Indigenous vegetation has been allowed to regenerate and over 1500 shrubs and young trees have been planted by the British Trust for Nature Conservation, creating a natural habitat for birds, wildlife and plants in the area. 
The industrial history of the site is commemorated with railway artefacts and signage made from old railway sleepers, and the entire park is tended by volunteers",2,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1c/39/b9/4a/the-industrial-heritage.jpg,2020-10-31,2020-10-24,2020-10-24,en,Addiscombe Railway Park,21357347,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g504167-d21357347-r775390604-Addiscombe_Railway_Park-Croydon_Greater_London_England.html
