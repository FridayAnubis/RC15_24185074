I arrived at 3pm expecting a guided tour to be available as it is on most Sundays, but the workers said it was not going ahead that day.
I explained I had come especially for it, and a volunteer guide called Tony said he would give me a tour anyway.
It was excellent.

He explained the history of the mill, the milling equipment inside, the gin trade, and some social history.
He was eloquent and funny and I learnt a lot.

I really recommend a visit, to what has to be one of London's hidden gems which is overlooked by most Londoners.

After the tour I went into the cafe and had a further chat with Tony and Beverly who works there, it was great.
They were very kind to explain lots about the building and the wider site and East London in general.
I cannot thank them highly enough!

I think a typical visit would last one hour, perhaps a bit more as it is nice to have a drink in the cafe and look at a small but well stocked souvenir shop with interesting booklets about the mill and local area.

A visit could be combined with a heritage walk along the adjacent Lea river, very scenic.

The website doesn't describe how to get there well enough, so I will have a go.
I travelled using London Underground, the venue is a six to seven minute walk from the station.
Go to Bromley-By-Bow station on the Hammersmith & City and District Lines.
Exit the station, then turn left and almost immediate right into a subway under the main road flyover.
At the end of the short subway, exit and turn left and head along the slip road (Hancock Road) towards the Tesco petrol station, about a one minute walk.
Keep walking and turn right into Three Mills Lane where on your right is a large Tesco superstore.
Then there is a river, walk across the bridge over the river and The House Mill is on your left.
Press the buzzer marked ""Cafe"" on the large old blue door to get in.
On your right is another mill with a clock tower which is a different mill, and ahead of you is a security lodge.
If you get to the lodge then you have walked past the House Mill and need to turn back and walk about 30 seconds to the blue door.",0,,2024-11-30,2024-11-25,2024-11-25,en,House Mill,15001535,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d15001535-r981811036-House_Mill-London_England.html

And with a mix of canals and the real river, bridges and land masses become so indistinguishable from each other that google map would suggest you to walk home and take a nap instead.

And there’s this Three Mills Island, a man-made island in the midst of housing developments and conservations. The island can be divided into two parts, the west being a park, the east its mill factories. The clock mill is now a college. The wind mill has gone to wind mills’ virtual cemetery+. The (tidal) water mill is now an attraction, the House Mill I’m trying to tell you about all along.

The miller’s house was destroyed by Blitz bomb(s) and rebuilt as a visitor centre with a café. It connects with the Grade I listed house mill.

No access allowed without a guided tour as I was told that some of the many wooden tiles were dangerous to walk on. Having tried stepping on every pre-warned tile, I'd say they did get rough at times.

Our tour includes a model demonstration (front) of how the tidal mill is supposed to behave. As tidal water is trapped (by a gate, reservoir just upstream of the house) during high tides and subsequently released through the mill, the turning serves two function – grinding grains, as well as bringing up sacks of grain from ground floor to storage.

The mill now rests in peace (you’ll see its corpse towards the end of the tour) and the water gate is long lost. I heard restoration if barely possible would still some time far far away.

+This is a subtle way of saying that the corpse is nowhere to be found.

I'm going to downgrade my previous review of the railway park to a single star. I stopped clearing rubbish from the railway park over winter 2021-22 but didn't restart when the weather got better in the spring because too many people obviously don't care about the environment and the litter problem has become so bad it's genuinely depressing. Part of the problem is that Croydon council didn't see the need to add more litter bins, but then they are financially restrained. The idea that care of Croydon's green spaces should be devolved to local groups isn't really an act of democracy but is rather another way to save money; a full partnership between the council and the local 'friends of' groups would be a better way of ensuring accountabilty, and may have prevented the parks being left unlocked at night. It's the night time when much of the littering - empty bottles and cans of alcohol - occurs, though drinking and casual recreational drug use is not uncommon during daylight hours. Dog faeces are another perennial problem, with no official patrols of the railway park to record breaches of the law or issue fines.
What was something of a haven during lockdown has become a nightmare, despite the best efforts of the volunteers, and until the government understands mental health issues and the relationship between declining mental wellbeing and the cost of living crisis, including providing much more money to local councils for upkeep of green spaces along with funds to ensure the provision of good local services, it's not going to improve any time soon.",0,,2022-07-31,2022-08-14,2022-08-14,en,Addiscombe Railway Park,21357347,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g504167-d21357347-r854038103-Addiscombe_Railway_Park-Croydon_Greater_London_England.html

The Addiscombe railway branch line was opened in 1864 following the acquisition of the Mid Kent Railway by South Eastern. It was closed in May 1997 to allow construction of Croydon Tramlink which uses part of the former route of the Woodside & South Croydon line, itself closed down in May 1983.
The station, demolished before full planning permission was granted, was turned into a housing development and the park site given over to Croydon Council by Bellway Homes in 2003. 
Addiscombe Railway Park was opened to the public on 26 May 2007 but suffered from flooding after heavy rain - the pathway crosses Norbury Brook somewhere around Dalmally Passage and the subsoil is impervious London Clay - since partially remedied by asphalting the surface to provide a cycle and footpath along much of its length.
Indigenous vegetation has been allowed to regenerate and over 1500 shrubs and young trees have been planted by the British Trust for Nature Conservation, creating a natural habitat for birds, wildlife and plants in the area. 
The industrial history of the site is commemorated with railway artefacts and signage made from old railway sleepers, and the entire park is tended by volunteers",2,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1c/39/b9/4a/the-industrial-heritage.jpg,2020-10-31,2020-10-24,2020-10-24,en,Addiscombe Railway Park,21357347,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g504167-d21357347-r775390604-Addiscombe_Railway_Park-Croydon_Greater_London_England.html

One of the original buildings is re-purposed into an art gallery, which was the best part of our visit this time. The art that we saw was the finalists of John Ruskin Prize Exhibition, and the art was spectacular.
We had the chance to visit one of the in-house artists who was working in one of the container studios. He had time to show us his set-up and explained his art discipline. Around the container village are several art sculptures made by welding old bicycles, scrap copper cylinders etc. to create mobile sculptures. Sadly, none of them were moving and they didn't look as though they would move on a busy tourist day in the summer time either.
The Wharf has a lovely café called the Orchard Café. Great food, lovely views of the area through the large glass windows and fantastic staff.

Every now and then my old man would go back to London to see family and friends, on one of these trips he went back to Abbey mills to catch up with his old colleagues and I tagged along. I was five or six years old at the time and I can remember how fascinated and awestruck I was. One of my dad's old workmates had finished a maintenance job on one of the biggest pumps and I was given the privilege of starting it up. I can still remember being scared at the colossal noise that it made.

It's a privilege to be able to see how everything works and it's hard to book a visit so look out for opportunities during Open Hoise weekend and apply early.  Restoration to the paintwork inside has continued apace and when finished it will be stunning.  

My visit this time included a sewer walk!  If you are in any doubt about doing it don't worry.  You get full protective clothing: disposable overalls, 2 layers of gloves, socks to put on over your own, thigh length wader boots, a hard hat and you are fully harnessed.  12 of us went down the sewer and 4 staff with bright torches so it wasn't scarily dark.  A man about 6' 2"" stood up straight, there were only a couple of places where he needed to bend his head to go past.  It was one of my concerns that it would be a confined space which would trigger claustrophobia but truly, it's so big there's less space on a crowded rush hour underground train!  

Did it smell?  A bit, but it wasn't gag inducing, if you're worried put some Vicks or something like that under your nose.  Was it slippery?  Not really, the boots you have on have metal spikes in the soles and dig into anything soft so grip well.  Although it had rained a couple of hours before we went in the sewer there was only about 6"" of water so nothing to worry about.  You get excellent briefing from the staff on what to expect.  You climb down a wall ladder and are fully harnessed and cannot fall, everyone managed it. You can take a camera but NOT a mobile phone to take pictures.  

We had an excellent talk about how the sewer system started and a talk and video about the new system being installed.  And to finish off we had the most wonderful lunch!  I highly recommend this experience.  Good luck with trying to book.

After visiting Three Mills nearby I mounted the Greenway via the Abbey Lane Open Space and wandered east along it several hundred metres until I came to a spot with a clear panorama of the buildings.  You can also take Abbey Road or West Ham DLR or the Jubilee / District / Hammersmith & City lines to West Ham.

Thames Water did me proud!

I wasn't there for the buffet lunch, but it was excellent, but far too much for us to eat. My purpose was the lectures - absolutely excellent - about the history of sewage management and the develop of London sewers under the control of Bazalgette.  We then enjoyed an excellent, well-explained and very relaxed tour of the Pumping Station itself, followed by the primary purpose of my visit, the walk-through tour of the sewers. 

A short mini-bus hop to a nearby works site, then dressed up into our ""sewer rat"" uniform - socks, groin-high boots, two layers of gloves, a proper onesie, helmet, safety harness and box with gas mask!  Then we were clipped onto the safety system before descending the ladder into the huge sewer. Excellent commentary and explanations as we were guided through the c.1905 sewer up as far as a big junction and a view of the much older Bazalgette sewer - all of them so well built they never need rebuilding or - even - repointing!!  Back to base along the storm drain, adjacent to the sewer to cope with the - up to - 40 times increase in flow of a rainstorm.

It is a privilege to visit these buildings and although the tour was unstructured, the staff were very knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions.  The exhibition inside is very interesting but we didn't have enough time to look at it all properly and the map was so small and high up I couldn't really see it which was a shame.

I am pleased I went, however it is far less colourful inside than Crossness which is a true sight to behold.  There again Abbey Mills is still a working pumping station (fully automated) and Crossness has been lovingly restored by a dedicated team of volunteers.   It warrants a ""Good"" rating - so 3 1/2 stars really.

The outside of the building is worth a good look - take some binoculars if you want to see the higher up detail eg the Minton tiles and the weather vane which has a story all of its own. Get there by going to Abbey Road DLR, turn right, follow the road round and turn left into to Abbey Lane; Greenway was closed off for redevelopment when I went.
