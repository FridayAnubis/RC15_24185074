I arrived at 3pm expecting a guided tour to be available as it is on most Sundays, but the workers said it was not going ahead that day.
I explained I had come especially for it, and a volunteer guide called Tony said he would give me a tour anyway.
It was excellent.

He explained the history of the mill, the milling equipment inside, the gin trade, and some social history.
He was eloquent and funny and I learnt a lot.

I really recommend a visit, to what has to be one of London's hidden gems which is overlooked by most Londoners.

After the tour I went into the cafe and had a further chat with Tony and Beverly who works there, it was great.
They were very kind to explain lots about the building and the wider site and East London in general.
I cannot thank them highly enough!

I think a typical visit would last one hour, perhaps a bit more as it is nice to have a drink in the cafe and look at a small but well stocked souvenir shop with interesting booklets about the mill and local area.

A visit could be combined with a heritage walk along the adjacent Lea river, very scenic.

The website doesn't describe how to get there well enough, so I will have a go.
I travelled using London Underground, the venue is a six to seven minute walk from the station.
Go to Bromley-By-Bow station on the Hammersmith & City and District Lines.
Exit the station, then turn left and almost immediate right into a subway under the main road flyover.
At the end of the short subway, exit and turn left and head along the slip road (Hancock Road) towards the Tesco petrol station, about a one minute walk.
Keep walking and turn right into Three Mills Lane where on your right is a large Tesco superstore.
Then there is a river, walk across the bridge over the river and The House Mill is on your left.
Press the buzzer marked ""Cafe"" on the large old blue door to get in.
On your right is another mill with a clock tower which is a different mill, and ahead of you is a security lodge.
If you get to the lodge then you have walked past the House Mill and need to turn back and walk about 30 seconds to the blue door.",0,,2024-11-30,2024-11-25,2024-11-25,en,House Mill,15001535,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d15001535-r981811036-House_Mill-London_England.html

This is the most interesting thing we've done in London so far. This ancient tidal mill is open on Sundays 11-4 pm from April to the end of Nov with the last tour at 3 pm. You do need to book via Facebook, but we got an immediate response and a warm welcome. The hour-long tour with an enthusiastic and knowledgeable volunteer guide takes you from the attic grain silos right down to the old waterwheels and includes some interesting info about the surrounding area too. Afterwards, the bargain £10 tour ticket includes a hot drink in the Millers House cafe.

By chance I found the House Mill and realised it would be a great venue for one of our trips. 16 of us had a brilliant tour with excellent food. Definitely worth a visit on a Sunday in the summer or to arrange a tour for a group of 12 or more.

However, we were provided with a feedback form to complete and return once the tour was finished. We didn’t have a pen, so decided to do the 21st century thing and leave a Tripadvisor feedback.
We thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour and found it both informative and enjoyable.
The guide was excellent and had an obvious passion for the mill.
Unfortunately on our departure we were accosted by an elderly lady, who asked for our feedback forms… As we were in a hurry to get back to our car to pick up our son, we begin to explain that we didn’t have time, but would leave a review. She became extremely unpleasant and assailed us with accusations of taking advantage of a free tour, without providing any kind of feedback or donation.
I think going forward that if they charged a small fee for the tour, people would know where they stand and would not have to suffer the unpleasant haranguing that we did.

This mill (and two others next door) played a major part in London's baking and gin history in the late 1700s.   Now run by lovely volunteers, the place is all-original, with the huge water wheels still intact.  We got a great 50 minute tour for £4!  Lots of insights into the unusual physical structure of the building, the milling process, and the insane working conditions back then.  Thanks Robert!

And with a mix of canals and the real river, bridges and land masses become so indistinguishable from each other that google map would suggest you to walk home and take a nap instead.

And there’s this Three Mills Island, a man-made island in the midst of housing developments and conservations. The island can be divided into two parts, the west being a park, the east its mill factories. The clock mill is now a college. The wind mill has gone to wind mills’ virtual cemetery+. The (tidal) water mill is now an attraction, the House Mill I’m trying to tell you about all along.

The miller’s house was destroyed by Blitz bomb(s) and rebuilt as a visitor centre with a café. It connects with the Grade I listed house mill.

No access allowed without a guided tour as I was told that some of the many wooden tiles were dangerous to walk on. Having tried stepping on every pre-warned tile, I'd say they did get rough at times.

Our tour includes a model demonstration (front) of how the tidal mill is supposed to behave. As tidal water is trapped (by a gate, reservoir just upstream of the house) during high tides and subsequently released through the mill, the turning serves two function – grinding grains, as well as bringing up sacks of grain from ground floor to storage.

The mill now rests in peace (you’ll see its corpse towards the end of the tour) and the water gate is long lost. I heard restoration if barely possible would still some time far far away.

+This is a subtle way of saying that the corpse is nowhere to be found.

It is reputed to be the largest Mill of its kind in the world. We wound our way through nooks and crannies, seeing the process of producing gin, if the Mill was working. Much of the original interior remains. An interesting, quirky venue for weddings and other events, already hosting musical events and craft fairs. We had quality sandwich lunch with good variety,at very reasonable prices, freshly made whilst we toured the Mill. Staff are volunteers thus all proceeds go directly to the restoration fund.
