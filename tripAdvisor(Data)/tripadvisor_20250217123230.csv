Probabilmente House Mill, costruito nel 1776, è il più grande mulino a marea rimasto al mondo, ha smesso di funzionare all'inizio della seconda guerra mondiale. Il Clock Mill, risalente invece ai primi anni dell'ottocento, ha smesso di funzionare negli anni cinquanta del novecento e oggi fa parte dei più grandi studi cinematografici londinesi. Si visitano solo di domenica, dalle 13 alle 16 da maggio ad ottobre (a quest'ultimo risale la mia escursione).",38,,2019-12-31,2020-11-16,2020-11-16,it,Three Mills and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park,4724430,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d4724430-r777302316-Three_Mills_and_Queen_Elizabeth_Olympic_Park-London_England.html

The reality is that few oif the attractions were open when we visited on a weekend, and although the area is interesting to walk round, we were generally disappointed with the number of the attractions which were open to the public.

We wanted to visit the Abbey Mills Pumping Station - it was closed to the public. We wanted to visit the Farady Lighthouse - it was closed to the public. With one exception, the various historic buildings were closed to the public.

After discovering there were no disabled services or parking we had to wait over half an hour before being searched for ‘sweets’ we were herded round to the studio. Another 10 minute wait while discussions took place only to be herded back to the entrance and told “sorry there are no more seats?” Then sent home. A free beer promised on arrival was not there, tickets said ‘only bottled water allowed in the studio’ but this was taken off us, searched for and sweets removed, unfriendly outside NON disabled toilets was a portacabin in the car park. I suggest staying well away from Eventbrite bookings as truth is completely missing from their promises and ‘guaranteed ticketed seating’ is just a con to get you there. Absolute waste of time, all future Eventbrite bookings now cancelled and will never use them again. Do not trust this organiser as you will most likely have wasted travel time.

No one looked at our tickets(!) and security were removing food and drink (including bottled water) from people. When asked if we would get those back, the guy said they would be on a table ready when you leave. I said what about if you want a drink whilst the show was recording and was told we would get bottled water in the studio... yeah work that one out? It was a lie as there was no bottled water available in Stage 6, so clearly lied too. 

The only toilets available were portacabin ones. Facilities here are dire. I've been to many recordings, Television Centre, The London Studios (now closed) and Elstree, never have we had food and water removed and all have provided inside toilets. 

I don't think I will be returning here again.
